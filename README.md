This repository includes three academic projects for the course Artificial Intelligence II of MSc in Computer Science University of Athens (UoA) - Fall Semester 2023.

The three projects deal with sentiment analysis on a binary classification problem. The sentiment analysis is a positive or a negative movie review. </br>

<ins>Brief project description</ins></br>
**Homework 1:** Use of sklearn python module to develop and test different Machine Learning algorithms for binary classification. The predictive performance of each model was tested. </br>
**Homework 2:** Use of PyTorch feed forwards networks and deep learning techniques with *Linear* hidden layers to create a feed forward neural network for sentiment binary classification. </br>
**Homework 3:** Use of PyTorch feed forwards networks with bidirectional *LSTM*, *GRU* cells.

Author: Spanos Nikolaos (Candidate of the MSc) </br>
Supervisor: Professor Manolis Koumparakis

Final grades:
- Homework 1: 10/10
- Homework 2: 10.5/10
- Homework 3: 10.5/10
